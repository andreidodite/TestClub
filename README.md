Future of Test Automation 


I believe that each company will need to have both manual and automation testers because in my opinion you cannot make automation without manual testing.
This parth will increase a bit while I suspect that manual testers will be a victim during this pandemic and future years.

In my project there are auto testers running a pipeline Cypress.io based.
I think you need a strong manual testing skills to become a good AUTOMATION TESTER because you need some eagle eyes.
